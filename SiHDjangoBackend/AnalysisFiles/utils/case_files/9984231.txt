Digitally signed by ASHWANI PRAJAPATI For the sake of convenience, the facts as narrated in Writ Petition No.13717 of Date: 2022.04.18 17:01:17 IST 196 2021 are taken into consideration. The petitioners have filed this writ petition challenging the work order dated 17.07.2021 (Annexure P/4) issued by the respondent No.3 - Commissioner. In terms whereof, the selected Vocational Training Providers (VTPs) have been allotted schools as per the list Appendix-1 enclosed thereto for imparting vocational education. They have been further asked to ensure presence of one Vocational Trainer per trade in every school allotted to the VTPs by 31.08.2021 as per the agreement and instructions attached thereto. It is further required that the minimum educational qualification of the Vocational Trainer shall be in accordance with the parameters prescribed in Appendix-2 and for these selections, a transparent procedure as per Appendix-3 shall be adopted. The case of the petitioners is that they were appointed to the post of Vocational Trainers through an outsourcing agency in the year 2016. Their appointment made through an outsourcing agency is in line with the circular dated 24.03.2017 (Annexure P-2) issued by the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Department of School Education and Literacy, New Delhi to the Principal Secretaries (School Education) of all States/UTs regarding the guidelines for enlisting quality contractual Vocational Trainers in the schools. Clause 2.0 of the said circular provided for dual mode of engagement of Vocational Trainers by the State. Under sub-clause (i) thereof, appointment of Vocational Teachers/Trainers in schools could be made directly as per the qualification and experience provided therein and under sub-clause (ii) such appointment could Signature Not Verified SAN be made through Vocational Training Providers in accordance with the criteria Digitally signed by ASHWANI PRAJAPATI Date: 2022.04.18 17:01:17 IST provided thereunder. The petitioners were appointed through the outsourcing 197 option. They continued on the mercy of the outsourcing company. However, respondent No.3 has made certain communications from time to time either interfering with their appointments or the payments. The petitioners were communicated by the District Education Officer that in the light of a letter dated 30.03.2020 (Annexure P-5) issued by the Commissioner, Directorate of Public Instructions, Bhopal pertaining to the session 2019-20, sooner or later the services of Vocational Trainers could be brought to an end. However, since they were later on absorbed by the State Government by promising grant of Rs.645/- per day as wages, therefore, the said communication dated 30.03.2020 was not given effect to. It is further submitted that the petitioners have rendered about 4-5 years of service as on date and are still continuing in service as such. All of a sudden, by the impugned order dated 17.07.2021 (Annexure P-4), the respondent No.3 has issued the work order to the selected Vocational Training Providers for the session 2021-22, inter alia for making fresh appointments of Vocational Trainers in place of the present incumbents of the post of Vocational Trainers. Consequently, the petitioners are on the verge of being ousted from the concerned schools. In the event the respondents are allowed to proceed with the impugned order, the services of the petitioners would be put to an end and they will have to face the fresh selection process to secure appointment. It is contended that once the petitioners are discharging their duties on the post of Vocational Trainers, replacing them by another set of Vocational Trainers is untenable in the eye of law. As such, the prayer sought for in all these petitions Signature Not Verified SAN is primarily to the effect that the posts being held by the petitioners be Digitally signed by ASHWANI PRAJAPATI continued in the present form. That the contentions of the respondents cannot Date: 2022.04.18 17:01:17 IST 198 be accepted for the various grounds urged therein.
